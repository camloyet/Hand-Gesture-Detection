## Hand Gesture Recognition with OpenCV and MediaPipe
This repository contains the source code for a real-time hand gesture recognition system developed using Python, OpenCV, and the MediaPipe library.

## Overview
The hand gesture recognition system utilizes computer vision techniques to track and analyze hand movements through a webcam feed. It includes functionalities for hand landmark detection, bounding box calculation, and gesture classification.

## Features
Real-time Hand Tracking: Utilizes the MediaPipe library for efficient hand tracking and landmark extraction from the webcam feed.

Modularized Code: Implements a modularized code structure with classes for keypoint and point history classification, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

User Interface: Includes a dynamic user interface allowing users to select different logging modes and capture specific gestures for dataset creation.

Dataset Contribution: Contributes to the development of a hand gesture dataset, laying the foundation for model training and potential future improvements in accuracy and robustness.
